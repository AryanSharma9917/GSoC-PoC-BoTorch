# GSoC-PoC-BoTorch


The above code is implementing an optimization algorithm for a constrained black-box function using the BoTorch library. It defines a number of functions and parameters related to the optimization, such as generating initial data, defining a multi-output GP model, optimizing the acquisition function to get a new candidate and noisy observation, and updating the list of best values observed randomly.

The code is using a variety of tools from the PyTorch library, such as tensors, device specification, and random number generation. It is also using the BoTorch library, which is a library built on top of PyTorch for Bayesian optimization.

Here is the desired output-
